\section{Libraries}
If you were using eclipse this term, chances are that lwjgl and other libraries are not installed on your computer. This program uses the slick util library and lwjgl. To install the libraries library, go to the following websites.\\
\url{http://slick.ninjacave.com/slick-util/}\\
\url{http://www.lwjgl.org/download}\\

Drag the jar files and the OS X natives into the \texttt{Library/Java/Extensions} folder on a Mac.

More info can be found at\\

\section{Running from the Jar file}
If you have successfully installed the library, then move the new jar file inside the same folder as the assets folder, and run.

\section{Running from Terminal}
Navigate to the \texttt{src} folder in terminal using the \texttt{cd} command, and then dragging in the \texttt{src} folder.
\begin{verbatim}
cd /path/to/dir/3d/src 
\end{verbatim} 
Compile the code.
\begin{verbatim}
javac *.java
\end{verbatim} 
And then run the program (WalkAround.java is the main class)
\begin{verbatim}
java WalkAround
\end{verbatim}
