\section{Goals}
The goal of the project is to create a maze that the player has to find his way out of.  A maze will be generated, and the player, in a first person view, will try to get out of the maze.

\section{Design Choices}
We will use lwjgl and OpenGL as our graphics engine.  There will need to be maze generation, which has to be represented in the game world, and the player has to be able to move around in the world.
